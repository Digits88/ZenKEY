      <p>Every computer is different. Whilst Microsoft Windows provides many very 
        nice and friendly possibilities, every version of Windows differs in terms 
        of what it can do and how things are setup. Many words, but it basically 
        boils down to the fact that some ZenKEY actions will just not work on 
        some computers.</p>
      <p>Some known issues are listed below:</p>

  <tr> 
    <td width="498" height="198">
      <p class="Bolded">Some 'Windows Folder', 'Windows Special Folders' and 'Windows 
        System Folder' actions just open the 'C:'&quot; drive</p>
      <p class="NormalText">This can happen because your windows does not have 
        these folders configured (e.g. A computer without a network card might 
        not support 'My Network places') or does not support them (e.g. 'Windows 
        98' does not support 'My Pictures').</p>
      <p class="Bolded">Some 'Windows programs' and 'Windows Utilities' give the 
        message &quot;It appears that XYZ could not be executed...&quot;</p>
      <p class="NormalText">Different versions of Windows install different utilities 
        and can also be configured during installation to include or exclude certain 
        items. These item are just not included in your windows installation. 
        Sorry. </p>
      <p class="Bolded">Some Windows are not so obedient and go a bit weird when 
        I minimize them or send them to the tray</p>
      <p class="NormalText">Ultimately, each Window has total control over how 
        it behaves. Whilst Windows provides a standard way of interacting with 
        them, they can basically do whatever they want. This means that there 
        is really no way to guarantee that a program or application window will 
        do what ZenKEY asks it to. Sorry, but that's actually half of the power 
        of Windows - application freedom - Live and let live baby.</p>
