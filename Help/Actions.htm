An action performs some form of task. The different types of actions in
ZenKEY are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="Bolded">Run or open a file</span> - Launches a
program or opens a document with its associated application. If you
launch a a program that is already running, you can choose whether this
program should be brought to the foreground, or whether ZenKEY should
launch a new instance of it. You can also choose to start this program
when ZenKEY starts. If it is already running, it will be brought into
focus.</li>
        <li><span class="Bolded">Iconify a window</span> - Replace any
program window with a 'live'
icon, showing CPU and memory usage. Clicking on it instantly restores
the
window.<br>
        </li>
        <li><span class="Bolded">Control panel applet</span> - Directly
opens an item which appears in your control panel</li>
        <li><span class="Bolded">Media command</span> - Sends special
'Windows Media' command to the computer. These can be used to play,
pause or stop compatible Media players, change the system volume, bass
or treble, or even open default web browsers and e-mail clients.</li>
        <li><span class="Bolded">Open a folder </span>- Opens a folder
in Windows explorer</li>
        <li><span class="Bolded">Open Internet location</span> - Opens
an internet resource, either a website (http://), a secure website
(https://) or an FTP site (File Transfer Protocol).</li>
        <li><span class="Bolded">Perform Internet search</span> -
Prompts you for search keywords and then opens your default browser
with the Internet Search Engine results</li>
        <li><b class="Bolded">Simulate a series of Keystrokes</b> -
Simulate a series of Keystrokes. You can use this to automate complex
tasks, type out commonly used sentences or greetings, type out
passwords (be careful - not military strength encryption!) or perform
formatting. In fact, anything you can do via the keyboard, you do via
these actions.<br>
        </li>
        <li><span class="Bolded">Windows System commands</span> -
Performs operating system functions, such as shutting down your
computer of starting the screen saver.</li>
        <li><span class="Bolded">Winamp controls</span> - From playing
or pausing to changing volume, these commands allow you to
comprehensively control the Winamp media player.<br>
NOTE : These commands also work on many other media players, such as
QCD Player and STP, but these programs often implement only some of
these commands.<br>
        </li>
        <li><span class="Bolded">Window controls</span> -The commands
can be used to reposition a window, to change its' properties, to alter
its' transparency (XP and 2000 only) or even to send it to the system
tray. You can tell ZenKEY whether you want the action to be performed
on the currently active window (default), whichever window is lying
under the mouse cursor or to a group of selected windows.</li>
        <li><span class="Bolded">ZenKEY actions</span> - These actions
control ZenKEY and change its behavior. ZenKEY settings and options are
accessed here, as is the ZenKEY Configuration Utility</li>
        <li><span class="Bolded">ZenKEY menu</span> - Opens a menu item
containing other menus or actions. When you first create a menu, an
action is automatically placed inside this menu which you can then edit.</li>
