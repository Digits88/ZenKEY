ZenKEY
======

Home the ZenKEY, the Windows hotkey utility featuring window managment, auto-transparency, and infinite desktop and more.

ZenKEY allows you to control almost all aspects of your computer via the keyboard and mouse.
Using a Desktop map and keystrokes that work no matter what program you are in, you can:

	* Launch a program or bring it back into focus 
	* Open a document, folder or Internet resource 
	* Automatically make active or inactive windows transparent
	* Move across and place windows using an "infinte" desktop space
	* Minimize or maximize a window 
	* Resize, move or alter a window
	* Perform an internet search 
	* Issue a Media command, such as play, pause or volume up/down 
	* Start your screensaver or shutdown your computer 
	* Access hidden Windows utilities
	* Control Winamp or compatible media players (we love QCD Player!) 
	* Instantly display any menu of programs or actions at the mouse pointer 
	* Launch a program automatically on ZenKEY startup 
	* Manage and control windows
	* Move over an 'Infinite desktop' space
	* Set the Mouse pointer speed
	* Simulate a series of keystrokes
	* Switch between tasks
	* 'Iconize' any window and see its CPU and memory usage

Using the ZenKEY configuration utility, you can add any program, add or alter any menu,
and assign any keystroke to perform any action
